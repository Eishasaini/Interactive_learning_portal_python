# Interactive_learning_portal_for_Python
Online learning fulfils the thirst for knowledge and offers online content that can be delivered for the learner anywhere, anytime and at any age through a wide range of e-learning solutions while compared with the traditional learning system. It also provides rapid access to specific knowledge and information. With the rapid growth of voluminous information sources and the time constraint, the learning methodology has changed. Learners obtain knowledge through e-Learning systems rather than manually teaching and learning. The interactive learning portal is a Python-based project developed through Python Django and MySQL as a Database.
